          - paragraph [ref=e26]: Mountify started as a small experiment in a parking lot — trying to mount a phone and data without rattles, clutter, or cheap plastic. We now design small-batch hardware focused on feel, everyday usability, and clean integration with modern interiors.
          - paragraph [ref=e27]: No fake carbon, no loud branding. Just parts that make your car nicer to live with and more fun to drive.
